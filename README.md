This is an experimental cognitive architecture for multi-agent simulations.
The idea is to be able to support the creation and maintenance of narratives
which may be exchanged, retold, mutated, negated and so on and to move towards
a situation where agents posess a socially constructed identity and are
capable of self reflection.
